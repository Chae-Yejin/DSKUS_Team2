# Migration

Migration data shows international migrant stock by region, country ,or area of origin every five years from 1990 to 2020. 

We'll visualize the flow of the migration to see how the migration changes over time.

### Flow of Migration (by continent)

The number of migrants tends to increase over time on almost every continent. I used interactive graph to see the specific information (the number of migrants in a particular year on a particular continent). Since weather varies from country to country within a continent, it will be difficult to directly relate weather or food security data to migrant data by continent. However, this graph gives us an insight into migration over time.

### Flow of Migration (by country)

There are over 200 countries in the migration data. When I plotted all the countries on one graph, it was difficult to grasp the information because the graphs overlapped. So, I drew graphs of the top few countries, I will going to visulize the data from a particular country separately whenver we need it. As you can see frome the graph, the flow of migration over time varies for each country. We can compare this data with weather and food security data to determine the correlation between the data.

# Poverty

Poverty data shows the share of population below the international poverty line ($1.90 per day) by country from 1981 to 2019.

There are more than 170 countries in the poverty data. For the same reason as before, I drew graphs by extracting data from particular countries. Since the graphs vary from country to country, it will be difficult to get a particular insight from this data. However, poverty data will be sufficiently related to food security data, and eventually, we can associate this data with weather data or migration data.
